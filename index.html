        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a passionate and curious software development enthusiast with a strong interest in building real-world solutions through code.
        Currently participating in a hands-on internship program, I’m sharpening my skills in full-stack development, learning tools like Git, GitHub, and JavaScript.

    <p>
        I love tackling coding challenges, exploring new technologies, and collaborating with others to turn ideas into working projects.
        Whether it’s debugging tricky code or learning a new framework, I enjoy the journey of continuous improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to become a well-rounded developer who can contribute meaningfully to innovative tech teams, and create software that makes a difference.
